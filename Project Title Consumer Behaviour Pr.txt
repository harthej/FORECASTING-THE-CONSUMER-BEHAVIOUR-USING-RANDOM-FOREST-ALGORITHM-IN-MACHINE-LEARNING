Project Title: Consumer Behaviour Prediction Using Random Forest
Description:
This project implements a machine learning-based solution for predicting consumer behavior categories using a Random Forest classifier. It reads transaction and customer data from an Excel file (superstore.xlsx), cleans and preprocesses the dataset, and trains a classification model based on features like customer segment, product category, order quantity, sales, region, and unit price. The target variable, behaviour, is categorized into four classes: Environmental, Individual, Organisational, and Interpersonal.

Key functionalities include:

Data preprocessing and label encoding

Model training using the Random Forest algorithm

Prediction and evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report

Visualization of predicted vs. actual behavior frequencies

A GUI interface (via Tkinter) for file upload and dynamic data visualization
